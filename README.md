# Text-Generation-from-Story


**Language Used**: Python 3.6
**Libraries Used**: Keras, Numpy, NLTK

### Attached Files:
1. Code: (a) ModelCreation.py 	(b) TextGeneration.py
2. Corpus: wonderland.txt (Can be anything. Need to put the path of the text in both the python file - TextGeneration.py and ModelCreation.py).
3. Best Model: The saved weights of an RNN model, which performs better than other


### Run the code:

1. To run the ModelCreation, all the libraries need to be installed and the corpus wonderland.txt should be with the python file or needs to set the path of the file in code.
2. To run the TextGeneration all the libraries need to be installed and the corpus wonderland.txt should be with the python file or needs to set the path of the file in code. Also, need to mention the best weights file name based on the lowest lass function from the model creation. I have attached the best model, I have found till now, but it should be placed with the python file or needs to set the path of it inside the code.
