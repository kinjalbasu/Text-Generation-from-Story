# Text-Generation-from-Story
Text Generation from a Story

Lnaguage Used: Python 3.6
Libraries Used: Keras, Numpy, NLTK

Attached Files:
1. Code: (a) ModelCreation.py 	(b) TextGeneration.py
2. Corpus: wonderland.txt
3. Best Model: The saved weights of an RNN model, which performs better than other


Run the code:

1. To run the ModelCreation, all the libraries need to be installed and the corpus wonderland.txt should be with the python file or needs to set the path of the file in code.
2. To run the TextGeneration all the libraries need to be installed and the corpus wonderland.txt should be with the python file or needs to set the path of the file in code. Also, need to mention the best weights file name based on the lowest lass function from the model creation. I have attached the best model, I have found till now, but it should be placed with the python file or needs to set the path of it inside the code.
